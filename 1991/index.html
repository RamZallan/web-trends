    <p>Then Tim Berners-Lee said, "Let there be The Web"; and there was The Web.</p>
    <p>In 1989, a physicist at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, created what we all know as The Web. Distinct from The Internet, a network of networks, Berners-Lee's World Wide Web was a protocol for transferring files over The Internet. Berners-Lee thought it would be convenient if he and his fellow scientists could share data while remaining at their respective work-stations. He theorized a "webbed" structure, with documents linking to each other.</p>
    <p>After creating The Web, Berners-Lee drew from existing hyper-text languages to create the HyperText Markup Language, HTML. What stood out about HTML from its predecessors was the &lt;a&gt;, or anchor, tag. The anchor tag, as shown in the <a href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html">first website</a> could link to local or external files, including media or other HyperText documents. Not much was included in the first version of HTML, mainly tags for paragraph text, &lt;p&gt;, headers, &lt;h1&gt; - &lt;h6&gt;, and lists, &lt;li&gt; &amp; &lt;ol&gt;.</p>
